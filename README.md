# MSCS532 Assignment 4: Heap Data Structures â€” Implementation, Analysis, and Applications

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations and analysis for heap-based data structures as part of Assignment 4 in the MSCS532 Algorithms and Data Structures course. The primary deliverables include:

- **Heapsort Algorithm Implementation**
- **Priority Queue Implementation using Heap**
- **Empirical Analysis Comparing Heapsort, Quicksort, and Mergesort**
- **Comprehensive Report and Output Results**

## Files

- `heapsort.py`: Contains the implementation of the heapsort algorithm.
- `priority_queue.py`: Implements a priority queue using Python's heapq module.
- `empirical_analysis.py`: Runs empirical benchmarks for heapsort, quicksort, and mergesort, and demonstrates the priority queue.
- `output.txt`: Contains sample output from running `empirical_analysis.py`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the analysis script from the terminal:

   python empirical_analysis.py
